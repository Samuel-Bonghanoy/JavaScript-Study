// DATA TYPES IN JS
// EVERY VALUE IS EITHER AN OBJECT OR A PRIMITIVE VALUE

// 7 PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES

/*
1) Numbers
2) Strings
3) Booleans
4) Undefined means 'empty value'
5) Null or 'empty value'
6) Symbol(ES2015 introduced this) Value that is unique and cannot be changed
7) BigInt(EsS2020) Larger Integers than the Number Type can hold

Js has a feature called dynamic typing. This means that new variables do not need to 
have manually defined data types

It automatically determines the data type of the value when it is stored into a variable

We can assign a new value with a different data type to the same value ex.
let a = 2;
let a = "alpha";
